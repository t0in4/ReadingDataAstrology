    "horoscope": "Expect the unexpected at work today, dear Sagittarius, as the Virgo moon blows a kiss to unpredictable Uranus. Though there may be a chaotic energy around the office, this disorganization will allow you to shine  as long as you step up and take care of any business that's fallen to the wayside. You may also feel called to assume a leadership role, especially if your colleagues are scrambling to stay on track. Just remember to give yourself plenty of time to unwind when you get home for the evening as Luna blows a kiss to the nodes of fate, encouraging you to take care of your health."
